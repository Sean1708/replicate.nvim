# replicate.nvim

A simple plugin which interacts with REPLs in a language agnostic way.

## Installation

### Plugin Managers

I highly recommend that you install replicate.nvim with a plugin manager such as [vim-plug]. Each
manager has a slightly different way of working so see the specific manager's help, for example in
vim-plug you would put

    Plug 'Sean1708/replicate.nvim'

in your `init.vim` (usually `$HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim`) and run

    :PlugUpdate

to automatically install it.

### Other

Alternatively you can use a runtimepath manager such as [pathogen] or, if you're particularly
masochistic, you can even
[install it manually](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_05.html#05.4).
